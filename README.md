# Erlang-style processes for SWI-Prolog

This repo contains highly experimental code to create lightweight
Erlang-style processes based on Paul Tarau's engines/interactors.

Most likely the organization, interfaces and naming of files and
predicates will change in due time.

Work in progress by Torbj√∂rn Lager and Jan Wielemaker.
